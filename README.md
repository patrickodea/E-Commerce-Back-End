# E-Commerce-Back-End

## Description

This application was created so that internet retail companies can utilize a MySQL database and keep an up to date record of specific categories, products, and tags related to the sale, and inventory of their e-commerce business. This application uses Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database. The use of an ORM (object-relational-mapping) dependency (Sequelize) rather than strictly using MySQL query's helps make this particular projects code more readable and reusable, and helps further the organization of project code through destructuring of larger files into more manageable pieces. This can also help isolate bugs, keeps the code DRY, and makes code more maintainable for future development.
